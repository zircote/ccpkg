# Appendices

## Appendix A: Complete Manifest JSON Schema Reference

The normative JSON Schema for `manifest.json` is published separately at `spec/schemas/manifest.schema.json` in the [ccpkg repository](https://github.com/zircote/ccpkg). The schema in this appendix is informational.

Installers SHOULD validate manifests against the published JSON Schema.

## Appendix B: Reserved Package Names

The following package names are reserved and MUST NOT be used by third-party packages:

- `ccpkg` — reserved for the installer itself.
- `core` — reserved for future use.
- `test` — reserved for test fixtures.
