# Security Considerations

## Install-Time Safety

- Packages MUST NOT execute code during installation. The install process is declarative: extract, substitute config variables, register. There are no postinstall scripts.
- Installers MUST reject archives containing path traversal sequences (`../`) in any entry path.
- Installers MUST validate that all paths referenced in the manifest exist within the archive.

## Transport Security

- All remote fetches (archive downloads, registry queries, referenced mcpb bundles) MUST use HTTPS. Installers MUST reject non-HTTPS URLs for remote resources.

## Checksum Verification

Checksums provide integrity verification — they detect accidental corruption and transmission errors, not deliberate tampering. Cryptographic package signing is deferred to a future specification version (see [Supply Chain](/specification/security#supply-chain)).

- Installers SHOULD compute and verify SHA-256 checksums for all downloaded archives.
- If a manifest `checksum` field is present, the installer MUST verify it. A mismatch MUST abort installation.
- Registry entries MUST include checksums. Installers MUST verify registry-provided checksums.

## Secrets Management

- Config values of type `secret` MUST be masked in all log output, error messages, and diagnostic displays.
- Secrets MUST NOT be written to lockfiles, debug logs, or any file that may be committed to version control.
- Installers SHOULD use the host's secure storage mechanism (e.g., system keychain) when available.
- Secrets MUST NOT be embedded in package archives.

## Hook Safety

- Hook scripts execute with the user's OS permissions and have full filesystem access. Users MUST review hook scripts from untrusted sources before installation.
- Installers SHOULD display hook scripts for user review during installation.
- Hosts SHOULD apply timeouts to hook execution to prevent runaway processes.

## Supply Chain

- Registries SHOULD support package signing as a future extension.
- Users SHOULD prefer packages from known, trusted authors.
- Project lockfiles provide a reproducibility guarantee: team members install the exact same package versions with verified checksums.
