# Versioning

## Package Versioning

Packages MUST use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version: incompatible changes to the package's public interface (skills renamed or removed, config slots renamed, breaking behavior changes).
- **MINOR** version: backwards-compatible additions (new skills, new config slots with defaults, new commands).
- **PATCH** version: backwards-compatible fixes (bug fixes in scripts, documentation updates, improved prompts).

## Specification Versioning

The ccpkg specification uses date-based versioning (`YYYY-MM-DD`), following the convention established by the MCP specification:

- Each specification version is identified by its publication date.
- Breaking changes to the manifest schema or archive format require a new specification version.
- The `spec_version` field in `manifest.json` declares which specification version the package conforms to.
- Installers SHOULD support packages built against older specification versions when possible.

## Version Ranges

- Lockfiles record exact versions.
- The `compatibility` object in manifests uses semver range syntax (e.g., `">=1.0.0"`, `"^2.0.0"`, `">=1.0.0 <3.0.0"`).
- Registries MAY host multiple versions of the same package. Installers select the highest version satisfying the user's constraints.
