# Cross-Tool Portability

ccpkg achieves cross-tool portability by building on universal open standards and providing thin adapter mappings for tool-specific conventions.

## Universal Components

The following components are tool-agnostic and work across any host that supports the underlying standard:

| Component | Standard |
|---|---|
| Skills (`SKILL.md`) | [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) |
| MCP servers (`.mcp.json`) | [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) |
| LSP servers (`.lsp.json`) | [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) |
| Config schema | [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) |

## Component Portability Matrix

The following matrix indicates the portability status of each component type across known hosts. This is informational -- hosts not listed here may support any subset of components.

| Component | Claude Code | Copilot | Codex CLI | Gemini CLI | OpenCode |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Skills (SKILL.md) | Native | Via instructions | Native | Native | Native |
| MCP servers | Native | Native (COPILOT_MCP_ prefix) | Native | Native | Native |
| LSP servers | Native (via plugins) | Not supported | Not supported | Experimental (TS/JS) | Experimental (27+ languages) |
| Hooks | Native (14 events) | Native (6 events) | Minimal (2 events) | Native (11 events) | Plugin hooks (TypeScript) |
| Agents (AGENT.md) | Native | Native (.github/agents/) | Not supported | Experimental (sub-agents) | Native (custom agents) |
| Commands | Native | Not supported | Deprecated (prompts) | Native (TOML files) | Native (Markdown files) |
| Instructions | CLAUDE.md | .github/copilot-instructions.md | AGENTS.md | GEMINI.md (configurable) | AGENTS.md (fallback: CLAUDE.md) |

**Key:**
- **Native**: Component type is natively supported by the host
- **Via [mechanism]**: Component concept maps to a different host mechanism (adapter needed)
- **Not supported**: Host has no equivalent; component is silently skipped
- **Partial**: Some features of the component type work; others do not

Package authors SHOULD use per-component host scoping (see [Components Object](/specification/manifest#components-object)) to include host-specific variants of components. Authors SHOULD NOT assume all hosts support all component types.

## Tool-Specific Adapters

Four mechanisms handle tool-specific differences:

1. **Instruction file assembly.** Base + per-host overlay assembly via `components.instructions`, with output written to the host-specific filename from `targets.*.instructions_file`. See [Instructions](/specification/components#instructions).

2. **Targets object.** Per-host overrides in `manifest.json`. See [Targets Object](/specification/manifest#targets-object).

3. **Hooks.** Hosts MUST silently ignore unrecognized event types, enabling packages to include hooks for multiple hosts without conflict.

4. **Per-component host scoping.** The `hosts` field in structured component declarations limits a component to specific hosts. Installers silently skip non-matching components.

## Portability Guidelines for Authors

- Use `instructions.base` with per-host overlays. Do not hardcode tool-specific filenames.
- Prefer MCP for tool integration over host-specific mechanisms.
- Use `compatibility` to declare minimum host versions rather than excluding hosts.
- Use per-component `hosts` scoping for host-specific hooks or agents alongside universal skills.
- Use canonical event names for hook portability (4 of 5 hosts support native hooks; Codex CLI has minimal support).
- Scope agents to specific hosts via `hosts` -- agent formats are not yet portable across hosts.
- Scope LSP components to supported hosts (native in Claude Code; experimental in Gemini CLI and OpenCode).
- When targeting Copilot, use `targets.copilot.mcp_env_prefix` to declare the `COPILOT_MCP_` credential prefix.
- Test packages across multiple hosts when possible.
