# ccpkg

> An open packaging format for AI coding assistant extensions.

ccpkg is a self-contained archive format for packaging and distributing
skills, agents, commands, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers as a single
portable unit. One file, one install, zero post-install steps.

## Why ccpkg?

AI coding assistants are increasingly extensible, but sharing extensions
is fragmented and unreliable. ccpkg solves this with a universal format
built on open standards.

**For extension authors**: Package once, distribute everywhere. Your
skills, MCP servers, and hooks ship as a single `.ccpkg` file that works
across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Copilot, and other compatible
tools.

**For users**: Install extensions with confidence. Self-contained
archives mean no dependency hell, no broken installs, and no minutes-long
startup fetches. Lazy loading keeps your sessions fast.

**For teams**: Share curated extension sets with deterministic lockfiles.
Project-scoped packages travel with the repo. User-scoped packages stay
personal.

## Built on open standards

ccpkg composes existing specifications rather than replacing them:

| Standard | Role |
|---|---|
| [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) | Skill format (SKILL.md) |
| [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) | MCP server configuration |
| [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) | LSP server configuration |
| [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) | Package versioning |
| [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) | Manifest validation |
