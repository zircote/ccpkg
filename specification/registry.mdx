# Registry Protocol

Registries are OPTIONAL. They provide package discovery, search, and version resolution. No central authority is required; users MAY configure multiple registries, and registries are additive.

## Registry Index Format

A registry is a JSON file hosted at any URL. The file contains a package index:

```json
{
  "registry_version": 1,
  "name": "community-packages",
  "url": "https://registry.example.com/index.json",
  "packages": [
    {
      "name": "api-testing",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "Skills and tools for API testing workflows.",
      "author": {
        "name": "Example Org"
      },
      "url": "https://registry.example.com/packages/api-testing-1.0.0.ccpkg",
      "checksum": "sha256:a1b2c3d4...",
      "tags": ["api", "testing", "openapi"],
      "published_at": "2026-02-14T12:00:00Z",
      "downloads": 1234,
      "verified": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Registry index fields:**

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `registry_version` | REQUIRED | `number` | Schema version. Currently `1`. |
| `name` | REQUIRED | `string` | Human-readable registry name. |
| `url` | REQUIRED | `string` | Canonical URL of this registry index. |
| `packages` | REQUIRED | `array` | Array of package entries. |

**Package entry fields:**

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | REQUIRED | `string` | Package name. |
| `version` | REQUIRED | `string` | Package version (semver). |
| `description` | REQUIRED | `string` | Package description. |
| `author` | REQUIRED | `object` | Author object (same schema as manifest). |
| `url` | REQUIRED | `string` | Download URL for the `.ccpkg` archive. |
| `checksum` | REQUIRED | `string` | SHA-256 checksum of the archive. |
| `tags` | OPTIONAL | `string[]` | Searchable tags. |
| `published_at` | OPTIONAL | `string` | ISO 8601 publication timestamp. |
| `downloads` | OPTIONAL | `number` | Download count. |
| `verified` | OPTIONAL | `boolean` | Whether the registry has verified the package. |

## Registry Configuration

Users configure registries in their host settings:

```json
{
  "ccpkg": {
    "registries": [
      "https://registry.example.com/index.json",
      "https://my-team.github.io/packages/index.json"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Resolution Behavior

When a user installs a package by name (e.g., `ccpkg install api-testing`):

1. The installer queries all configured registries.
2. Matching packages are collected across registries.
3. If multiple versions match, the highest semver version is selected.
4. If the same name and version appear in multiple registries, the first registry in the configuration list takes precedence.

Registry URLs MUST use HTTPS (see [Transport Security](/specification/security#transport-security)).
