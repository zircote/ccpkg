## Overview

ccpkg is an open packaging format for distributing AI coding
assistant extensions. A ccpkg archive is a self-contained ZIP file
with a declarative manifest that bundles skills, agents, commands,
hooks, MCP servers, LSP servers, and configuration into a single
portable unit.

The format is built on open standards: Agent Skills (SKILL.md),
Model Context Protocol (MCP), Language Server Protocol (LSP),
Semantic Versioning, and JSON Schema.

## Key Concepts

- Self-contained ZIP archives (.ccpkg)
- Declarative manifest.json with typed configuration
- Universal core + thin tool-specific adapters
- Lazy loading for fast startup
- No central registry required
- No install-time code execution
